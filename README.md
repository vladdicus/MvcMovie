# Movie Rentals App (ASP.NET Core MVC)

This is a simple ASP.NET Core MVC web app written as part of the Week 1 Assignments by Colin Haugh for SPC's COP2839 course. I chose rental movies as the product for the CRUD app.

## Features, as described ijn the assignment requirements
- ProductController with an Index action that returns a strongly typed view.
- Strongly typed views for listing movies and adding new ones.
- Uses a Product model to display data for the movies.
- Includes a navigation Tag Helper and a form Tag Helper.
- Basic logging with mylogger (var name)
- In-memory list of movies.|

## How to Run
1. Install .NET 8 SDK (or the version required for this course).
2. Open the project in Visual Studio. A localhost link pop up in your default browser.
